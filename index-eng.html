                                Monday starts off very exciting as you have to follow the road from one end of Riga to the other.
                                I will start by taking a public transport that takes me to the tram and then on my way to Meža Street, where 9:30 will begin Athletic Gymnastics.
                                Here is an opportunity to improve your physical condition and also start a very good week with athletic activity.
                                After the start of this athletic day, I'm heading downtown to work.
                                At work, on Monday, new tasks and problems are usually encountered and are solved until the end of the day.
                                At around 7 pm, I am at home where I have to get on Tuesday and maybe do some work that I hadn't done in a day.
                                It is imperative to look at what will be done in the Linux System Programming course and prepare for it in a timely manner so that there is no excitement or uncertainty during practice. It is certainly worth mentioning that the mathematical logic homework is also done. The days usually end around twelve.

                    <p class="mb-5">
                            This morning you can sleep a little more than on Monday to leave relatively early, as today lectures start at 10:30. The first mind-teaching lecture is Mathematical Logic. After this lecture you should go for a quick lunch and work.
                            I get news at work, get new assignments, or keep up with things I started from the day before. You don't get to work on Tuesdays quite a bit, as the Linux System Programming course starts at 2:30 pm and goes hand in hand with exercises up to 18.
                            Then I come back to work and try to finish my work. I return home at about 8pm to 9pm. Often these days, the University of Latvia Basketball League games are held, where the team of the Faculty of Computer Science is represented.

                            No matter how unpleasant it is, but Wednesday morning starts very early. The campus should already be at 8:30 am for Mathematical Analysis II. Before these works, I really like to grab some coffee because in these lectures cheerfulness is really helpful in being able to concentrate well and understand a large amount of substance. This practical work is followed by Lecture II of Mathematical Analysis, where the new subject has to be studied theoretically and will be practically acquired in the next week's practical work. After this lecture the day is over and you can safely "promise" to work. New tasks and new challenges have certainly arisen in the work, and they are solved until 7 pm. Then go home, but as it is mid-week, it is necessary to go to the gym because, as we all know, well-maintained shape helps in the stressful life of everyday life. At peace these days, one usually meets around twelve.

                            Thursday also starts very early and two early mornings in a row is really a very good challenge and could even be said to be a discipline training event. The first lecture on this day is in the Basic Course in Web Design, where you learn a lot about the design world and how it is perceived - interesting! This lecture is followed by a lecture on Formal Grammar, one has to switch from art, and one might even say, from such a free flight of thought, to certain rules, algorithms, and rules to understand how these grammars are created and operated. Of course, the instructor makes one think and search for real-life relationships in order to get these formal grammars as close as possible to everyday situations. After this lecture maybe not so fast lunch, but also not to sit down, because it is already half day and have to go to work. When coming to work, you have to deal with new challenges and demands from the client, which often turn out to be very interesting and exciting. When the work is done, you have to go to a Special Workshop, where you really talk about the latest trends with the lecturer M.Vitins and understand the direction of technology in today's fast-growing world, but it is also necessary . After this talkative lecture one has to go to the basics of Web Design, where everything that had to be learned theoretically in the early hours of the morning must now be tried practically. After that you have to go to work, complete tasks that were not completed by day. I'm about nine at home and soon I have to go to bed.

                                Friday starts again early because it is exactly the same break as Monday morning. I get to the tram in one transport and then go to Athletic Gymnastics. After the workout you have to go to work and work properly this time, because this time you have to do everything that is missed by a week. It is also a good idea to relax with friends or spend time with your family on lunch, but if you don't get along, it is definitely time to watch a series or movie. Usually on Friday, a plan is made for the next week, which has to be reached, what nature is waiting for and which day will be the hardest one to come </p>

                                The first holiday has come in big steps and here it is worth saying that the holiday starts with a long sleep, because sleep is not a plus in the week, so this is the morning you need to sleep. Saturday morning starts with a long and hearty breakfast as all the previous weekday breakfast is skipped or very fast on the way. On Saturday, you also have to do some homework, put your desk in order, and organize your room so you don't have too much clutter. Then you should definitely vent your head for a walk along the sea or in the woods. Then, when these things are done, focus on training. Starting a Linux System Programming homework, which is usually very bulky and time consuming. When this is done, the latest movie or TV series is viewed

                                    The second holiday starts just like the first - with a good sleep, because what can be better than one sleep to eleven and plus one more sleep. After bed, breakfast followed by a trip to the University of Latvia, Jelgavas Street 3, where they do homework on different subjects, like Mathematical Logic, Mathematical Analysis, because what can be better than repetition? After that, I go home to help my parents with their homework, such as helping with the kitchen or washing dishes. After that, we look at a movie, look at next week's calendar, what's going on, what's going on there, and then we have to go relatively early to bed because, as we already know, Monday morning starts early!
